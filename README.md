# Repma - A Real Estate Property Management App (Project 2)

## Description

Repma is a full stack web application that utilizes Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a real estate property management app. Clients can register, log in, search and filter listings, save favorite listings, contact realtors, and schedule appointments. Realtors can create and edit listings, as well as approve appointment requests from clients. The frontend utilizes React to perform state management, including persistence of user login across components, and dynamically generate web pages that are mapped to RESTful endpoints. The backend is built with the Spring Framework and communicates with a PostgreSQL database.
